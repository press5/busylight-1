# busylight

A very lazy script for manual control of a Jabra/Plenom busy light.

Gives you a command interface where you can type the colour you want from a very limited list. Also pulses the light when Spotify is playing (Mac specific).

## Spotify
All of the Quartz/Applescript stuff serves the music player checking thread. If you're running on Windows/Linux or something other than Spotify you can feel free to completely ignore this whole section!
